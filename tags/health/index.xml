      <description>Dear sister, let’s talk about Health.
Health is everything. Without it, we cannot do anything nor enjoy life. For girls, there are much more issues to pay attention to.
1. Eat right. Eat healthy. Eat sufficient.
It’s been said before, but it’s worth saying again: you are what you eat. Food makes or break you.
Treat your body with the respect it, and you, deserve. Incorporate more fresh greens into your daily diet.</description>

      <description>1. Believe that your calling is closer than you think.
We spend so much time thinking about what our calling is and how we will fulfill it instead of trying to follow our curiosity or the excitement we feel towards something over the other.
2. Our calling may not be life-changing, but it guides our steps in the right direction.
A lot of people think their calling has to be something extraordinary or magical, but sometimes our calling may be very real and ordinary but it has the potential to make our lives extraordinary.</description>

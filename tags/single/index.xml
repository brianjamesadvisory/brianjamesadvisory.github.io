      <description>Hi friends,
When people ask you how things are going, you tell them “Fine. Everything’s fine.”
Because it is.
You’ve settled into a nice career, you love your roommate, and you’ve been eating well. Those five pounds you gained in the winter are gone and now you just stare at your flat stomach in the mirror, hoping it will unleash some secret about being happy. Grab the fat and revel in how little there is.</description>

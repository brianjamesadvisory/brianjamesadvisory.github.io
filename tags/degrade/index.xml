      <description>Never degrade yourself.
You should never beg someone for his presence.
Never beg for care, effort and time.
Never beg someone to come back or stay.
Never go down on your knees just to feel wanted.
If someone isnâ€™t willing to give you love, with his arms wide open, he is just wasting your time.
You deserve much more than that.
Never degrade yourself.
Never make a comedown.
No one, in any circumstances, is ever worth begging for.</description>

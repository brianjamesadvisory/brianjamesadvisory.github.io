      <description>My brothers,
Last month I had a day trip with my friends and need the mountain bike. But then I realised there was a small problem with the gear of my mountain bike, so I took my tools and tried to fix it (my first attempt ever). Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know why but after a while of trying hard, my bike was totally spoilt. Sign. Quite disappointing there. After all I had to rush to the bike shop to get another total new one.</description>

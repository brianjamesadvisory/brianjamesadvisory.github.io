      <description>Hi dear,
In this note I will be telling you a special technique. I would call this Mindset Amplification, which helps you to increase trust, prosperity and in other words, present the huge values of yourself.
One of my readers, John, asked me, &amp;ldquo;Thank you so much for your kind help and sharings. I usually follow you to read the posts. At times when I turned off my computer to sleep but noticed your new post, I still stayed up and finish them even though I was so sleepy.</description>

      <description>Oh dear,
In previous sessions, we have discussed about some &amp;ldquo;fundamental mistakes&amp;rdquo; guys usually make on their journeys to win the ladies of their lives. How about today? I will be talking about Honesty. The Honesty of Men.
Well, what makes you think about honesty? Currently how many definitions are there in your own dictionary? Where does honesty stand in your life&amp;rsquo;s priority?
To me, honesty is the key that enables me successes with ladies.</description>

      <description>My brothers,
&amp;ldquo;Admit it.&amp;rdquo;
Yes, that is the way, the action which helped me achieve a lot of successes in life, and with ladies. In the years living this life, I have never met a strong person with an easy past. And, a man would never go from zero to hero if he does not overcome a challenge, just to admit it.
Interesting yeah?
Back in the day I have to admit that I was terrible in terms of communication.</description>

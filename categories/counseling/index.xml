      <description>Never degrade yourself.
You should never beg someone for his presence.
Never beg for care, effort and time.
Never beg someone to come back or stay.
Never go down on your knees just to feel wanted.
If someone isn’t willing to give you love, with his arms wide open, he is just wasting your time.
You deserve much more than that.
Never degrade yourself.
Never make a comedown.
No one, in any circumstances, is ever worth begging for.</description>

      <description>Dear sister, let’s talk about Health.
Health is everything. Without it, we cannot do anything nor enjoy life. For girls, there are much more issues to pay attention to.
1. Eat right. Eat healthy. Eat sufficient.
It’s been said before, but it’s worth saying again: you are what you eat. Food makes or break you.
Treat your body with the respect it, and you, deserve. Incorporate more fresh greens into your daily diet.</description>

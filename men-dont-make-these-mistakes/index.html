<p>My brothers,</p>

<p>Last month I had a day trip with my friends and need the mountain bike. But then I realised there was a small problem with the gear of my mountain bike, so I took my tools and tried to fix it (my first attempt ever). Well, I didn&rsquo;t know why but after a while of trying hard, my bike was totally spoilt. Sign. Quite disappointing there. After all I had to rush to the bike shop to get another total new one.</p>

<p>That made me thinking though. When we started learning something, mistakes are unavoidable. Things do go wrong. Recently I failed with the microwave too since I messed up the functions without reading the instructions carefully. Yours might be the same. Our mistakes could be due to lack of time, lack of preparation and lack of knowledge. It could be due to one&rsquo;s nature. Say, you are likely to raise the temper quickly and judge things without consideration. Every single thing in life could end up miserable, not only in relationship.</p>

<p>Well, let me tell you some basic mistakes men usually make in dating. I think you if you are a beginner, you better read it.</p>

<p><ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-8118056608218129"

<h3 id="mistake-1-never-seek-for-help">Mistake 1: Never Seek For Help</h3>

<p>Imagine about an ugly tatoo, you tried so hard and made it yourself. You thought it looks eagle but actually more like a bit fat duck. If a professional tatoo artist looks at it, he would just laugh out loud &ldquo;Wow cool! You baby niece did that for you?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an analogy how many people never seek help and do things in their own terms. <a href="https://brianjamesadvisory.github.io/admit-it/">I admit that</a> relying on our own is good. However, over self-reliant on important stuff, especially when you are not very good at it is dangerous. You better seek for help from the experts. Like a good tatoo, asking for help from an artist is a no brainer.</p>

<p>Are women important to you? I think if you say <strong>no</strong> means you have some serious issues in relationships. Don&rsquo;t seek for a solution within your own limited capacity. Seek for help, for knowledge, guidance from the experts. That&rsquo;s how you can get the better results and reach your goals faster.</p>

<h3 id="mistake-2-trust-social-media-too-much">Mistake 2: Trust Social Media Too Much</h3>

<p>I can guarantee that no one on this Earth has the same characters as mine. I believe yours are unique, too. And I hold the belief that everyone of us is special and nobody shares exact 100% same characters.</p>

<p>So, why do you surf Facebook, read news and articles from social media saying that women have only one same type of character? Looks obsessed, materialistic, and demanding, etc.</p>

<p>I am not trying to convince you either. But when you still trust in media, as the way Trump&rsquo;s news did it. Brother, they are all fake news! While you are still so naive like that, good girls are one step closer to the arms of other men.</p>

<p><ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-8118056608218129"
     data-ad-slot="6785365126"
     data-ad-format="auto"></ins>

<h3 id="mistake-3-persuade-her-to-like-you">Mistake 3: Persuade Her To Like You</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Attractiveness is the start of everything.&rdquo; You may heard that once, don&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>Well, <strong>attractiveness</strong> is a kind of feelings. It is just like any other feelings. It can last for a while, and it can be gone eventually.</p>

<p>I have to emphasize on this one more time, <strong>attractiveness</strong> is a kind of feelings. Hence you can&rsquo;t convince her by logic, calculations or any kind of data analysis, my brother! Everything has to come down to feelings! Yeah.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I praised a girl, &ldquo;Every time I look at your eyes, I just want to do it forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She asked.</p>

<p>When she said that, I knew for sure she rarely received any compliment about her eyes. I then, &ldquo;Why? Because none has told you that your eyes are gorgeous dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My attractiveness went on to the moon after that. I showed her that I am the guy to know and appreciate beauty, while 99% of all the males she met previously were blind.</p>

<p>To make a girl like you, my friend, listen, focus on changing her feeling. Don&rsquo;t try to convince her. Acting like a good man, buying flowers, caring for her, worshiping her 24 hours, 7 days a week, etc. All are rubbish as long as she does not have a feeling for you.</p>

<h3 id="mistake-4-confess-your-feelings-desperately">Mistake 4: Confess Your Feelings Desperately</h3>

<p>There were times that I thought, I would get something if I make things clear and transparent. <a href="https://brianjamesadvisory.github.io/honesty-is-the-sexiest-charm/">Transparency usually is honesty</a>, and girls will trust you on it right?</p>

<p>So I then went on to text that girl. I wrote lots of caring notes. About 3 days, I immediately confessed my feelings towards her.</p>

<p>Early confession is miserable. I call this <em>premature ejaculation</em> in dating. She may not be done with her excitement, or maybe just a little bit. Then what&rsquo;s next when she you have nothing to lose?</p>

<p>Throw all the confessions aside. When you are experienced, you would know when she will <strong>miserably fall</strong> for you, into your arms. Sometimes it could just be days away!</p>

<h3 id="mistake-5-obey-women-like-a-little-slut">Mistake 5: Obey Women Like A Little Slut</h3>

<p>Sorry for my bad words if they fail you. Language is up to the use of each person. I sometimes use the word <em>a little slut</em> while having sex with women (dirty talk to make them more excited). Personally I don&rsquo;t have anything against this word.</p>

<p>The thing is, you truly are <strong>a little slut</strong> if you obey women in every-single-thing.</p>

<p><a href="amplify-your-mindset/">The power is in your hands</a>. It always is. Don&rsquo;t give it up too early in a relationship. Once the power is passed on, you have nothing left in this life.</p>

<p>My friend,</p>

<p>These are the 5 most stupid mistakes I personally made in my first days in dating. I think I have to voice it up to remind you about them. Because I don&rsquo;t want you to waste time making the same mistakes I did. Reserve that precious moments for the love of your life.</p>

<p>Take care,</p>

<p>Brian</p>

In this note I will be telling you a special technique. I would call this Mindset Amplification, which helps you to increase trust, prosperity and in other words, present the huge values of yourself.
One of my readers, John, asked me, &ldquo;Thank you so much for your kind help and sharings. I usually follow you to read the posts. At times when I turned off my computer to sleep but noticed your new post, I still stayed up and finish them even though I was so sleepy.</div>

In previous sessions, we have discussed about some fundamental mistakes guys usually make on their journeys to win the ladies of their lives. How about today? I will be talking about Honesty. The Honesty of Men.
Well, what makes you think about honesty? Currently how many definitions are there in your own dictionary? Where does honesty stand in your life&rsquo;s priority?
To me, honesty is the key that enables me successes with ladies.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">My brothers,
Last month I had a day trip with my friends and need the mountain bike. But then I realised there was a small problem with the gear of my mountain bike, so I took my tools and tried to fix it (my first attempt ever). Well, I didn&rsquo;t know why but after a while of trying hard, my bike was totally spoilt. Sign. Quite disappointing there. After all I had to rush to the bike shop to get another total new one.</div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">My brothers, today I will be talking about one thing, one action, that is
&ldquo;Admit it.&rdquo;
Yes, that is the way which helped me achieve a lot of successes, not just with ladies. In the years living this life, I have never met a strong person with an easy past. And, a man would never go from zero to hero if he does not overcome one challenge, just to admit he is weak at it, and needs help.</div>

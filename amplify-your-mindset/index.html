<p>Hi dear,</p>

<p>In this note I will be telling you a <em>special</em> technique. I would call this <strong>Mindset Amplification</strong>, which helps you to increase trust, prosperity and in other words, present the <strong>huge values</strong> of yourself.</p>

<p>One of my readers, John, asked me, &ldquo;Thank you so much for your kind help and sharings. I usually follow you to read the posts. At times when I turned off my computer to sleep but noticed your new post, I still stayed up and finish them even though I was so sleepy.&rdquo; He then added, &ldquo;However, I keep on screwing things up no matter how much I learned from you bro. <a href="https://brianjamesadvisory.github.io/admit-it/" title="Admit It">Honestly I am very shy in front of strangers</a>. Can you please help me with a method such that I could be more confident in conversations and in front of women? To be frank, I don&rsquo;t know what to say and what to do when talking to strangers, especially ladies. Thank you so much brother. John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hey, John. Yeah, I just only want to visit you right now and give you a punch in the face. Or worse, I would slap the hell out of you. You know why? Because you only spend the time reading up my stuff and never move your ass to apply them <strong>even once</strong>. And now what, you consider it as an <em>unsolvable</em> problem for yourself.
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-8118056608218129"
     data-ad-slot="6785365126"
     data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s bad. John, that&rsquo;s <em>real bad</em>.</p>

<p>Ok, never mind, let&rsquo;s calm down, and talk. Let me tell you what to do in this situation. Tell you what, <a href="https://brianjamesadvisory.github.io/men-dont-make-these-mistakes/" title="Men Don't Make These Mistakes">this is the problem</a> with your <strong>mindset</strong>. And talking about mindset, it is indeed a very simple issue. If you can strengthen it, bit by bit, day by day. After a while, your mindset will become solid and strong (til a level I would call it diamond). However, it is like paddling your boat upriver. If you pause a little, moment by moment, you make it weaker slowly. And then, again, after a while, you would still see yourself useless despite how strong you were last time.</p>

<p>To a shy person, his mindset has too little excercise. Every single time he meets women and does not dare to open up, the level goes down. Everytime he refuses to start a conversation with a stranger, his confidence decreases. Therefore, from time to time, without a real change, his mindset turns from <strong>weak</strong> to <strong>useless</strong>. So, in order to have a better, stronger and more confident mindset, there is no other way but training it, day by day. If you know you are not good in conversation, practice talking everyday. If you think you are bad at chatting with ladies, search for the opportunities to talk to them more. The best frequency is <strong>everyday</strong>, or at least weekly, but don&rsquo;t make it months. Persitence and consistency are the keys to have an excellent mindset to deal with almost everything in life. And of course, with girls, too.</p>

<p>How to amplify your mindset? Let me explain to you how this technique works. And you do not need to sum up every single point. Instead, this technique will help you accelerate 146%, a crazy pace. To newbies, this is a mandatory step. To the experienced guys, this technique will enrich your experiences more and more.</p>

<p>Well, let&rsquo;s think about all the interactions in our society. Oh better still, between every 2 persons. There shall be one who rejects, and one who is rejected, amirite? So let&rsquo;s think about the person who rejects and the rejected one, who has higher value? Of course that is the one who rejects. See, if you refuse lending money to someone, or you reject a promotion request from an employee, or you refuse donating to an untrustworthy beggar, etc. You are in higher value position in those situations.</p>

<p><strong>The same thing applies in relationship.</strong>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-8118056608218129"
     data-ad-slot="6785365126"
     data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>

<p>In every relationship, women reject only when they possess higher value than you. That&rsquo;s why they have the right to say no.</p>

<p>However it is quite simple to amplify your mindset. Right now, I want you to just reject women. However, don&rsquo;t just reject them like a cold-hearted loser. To <em>properly</em> reject a woman, first you need to talk to her. Approach women, talk to them, and then reject them eventually.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;. You may ask.</p>

<p>Okay, first of all please settle your mind about the types of girls you want to meet. Like, a hotgirl, an office woman, or show white ladies, students, etc. Talk to them. You don&rsquo;t need to memorise any pickup line or whatnots. Just talk. For beginner, <a href="https://brianjamesadvisory.github.io/honesty-is-the-sexiest-charm/" title="Honesty Is The Sexiest Charm">you can just be honest</a> as I was previously: &ldquo;I am quite nervous. But I want to talk to you.&rdquo; None of the girl wants to <em>appear rude</em>. Hence they will try staying back and talk to you <strong>even if they don&rsquo;t want so</strong>. Hmm well, if you think that is quite direct, you can fake asking about time. Like,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey dear, may I know what time is that?&rdquo; And when she starts looking at her phone, you just say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honestly I just want to talk to you, but I have not fully thought about a good way yet. So I just asked about time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, you should be <em>humble</em> at first. <a href="https://brianjamesadvisory.github.io/its-actually-the-way-you-say/">Try being passionate about whatever you are doing</a> and don&rsquo;t forget to express your interest in her, even just subtle. Keep on. If she is keen, try staying for a while more, then a little more.
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-8118056608218129"
     data-ad-slot="6785365126"
     data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>

<p>And then..</p>

<p>Wait until the conversation reaches its peak, the most exciting part of all, when she is fully into it. That&rsquo;s exactly the time you back off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;OMG, I just recall I have an urgent meeting with my business partner (showing your value here), reall wish to have another chance to meet you in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, you just turn your back and walk away, without asking her anything, any permission. Just talk to her like that. And that conversation was ended 5 seconds ago. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether she is interested in you or not. So, you left a big question mark in her mind, surprised why that interesting guy never asked for her number?</p>

<p>Brother, can see the point? You show her you are at higher value, and allow yourself to know that, you have the power to reject. And rejection shows value. Try applying it whenever you have the opportunity. The bigger the regret, the <em>greater</em> is your mindset. If she asks, &ldquo;You forgot asking my number!&rdquo;. Congratulations, you mindset is now <em>huge</em>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try it, John. It&rsquo;s not very complicated :)</p>

<p>Your friend,</p>

<p>Brian.</p>

Stop.
Stop looking for men.
Not on Tinder. Not at work. Not through mutual friends. Not on Facebook. Not even at parties.
You need to stop looking for men at all the wrong places.
Because you may not have realized it yet, but, the right men are right in front of you.
The right men for you aren&rsquo;t the ones shown in movies or written about in books.</div>

We spend so much time thinking about what our calling is and how we will fulfill it instead of trying to follow our curiosity or the excitement we feel towards something over the other.

A lot of people think their calling has to be something extraordinary or magical, but sometimes our calling may be very real and ordinary but it has the potential to make our lives extraordinary.</div>

When people ask you how things are going, you tell them “Fine. Everything’s fine.”
Because it is.
You’ve settled into a nice career, you love your roommate, and you’ve been eating well. Those five pounds you gained in the winter are gone and now you just stare at your flat stomach in the mirror, hoping it will unleash some secret about being happy. Grab the fat and revel in how little there is.</div>

In communication, especially with women, the gesture and the body language are much more important than the thing we say. Many, many times more. Do you know that, in reality, body language comprises up to 93% of the communication power, while the message is just little 7%.
Yes, that is true. Body language is the key factor deciding a winner or loser, not the message my friend.
So, what does body language comprise of?</div>

Let me tell you a story. Last month I had a day trip with my friends and need the mountain bike. But then I realised there was a small problem with the gear of my mountain bike, so I took my tools and tried to fix it (my first attempt ever). Well, I didn&rsquo;t know why but after a while of trying hard, my bike was totally spoilt.</div>

&ldquo;Admit it.&rdquo;
Yes, that is the way which helped me achieve a lot of successes, not just with ladies. In the years living this life, I have never met a strong person with an easy past. And, a man would never go from zero to hero if he does not overcome one challenge, just to admit he is weak at it, and needs help.</div>
